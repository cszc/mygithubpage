    <a id="hi-there" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hello World</h3>
    <p><b>Hi, I'm Christine.</b> I'm currently pursuing an MS at the University of Chicago Harris School's program in <a href="https://capp.uchicago.edu/">Computational Analysis and Public Policy</a>.</p>
    <p>I'm a programmer who likes working on social and civic problems with human impact. I love solving puzzles with code and data. Last summer, I served as a fellow in the Mayor's Office of Chicago where I shipped code, analyzed data, and recommended polices to solve the city's challenges related to sustainability, absenteeism, criminal justice, and self-driving cars. I also spent a good deal of the summer teaching policy wonks to code and honing my foosball skills.</p>
    <p>In previous lives, I was an international development project coordinator for <a href="http://www.edc.org/">Education Development Center</a>, a climate change organizer for the <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org">Union of Concerned Scientists</a>, an <a href ="http://pleasantvalleygardens.com/">agricultural intern</a> on a vegetable farm, and an apprentice builder of solar hot air panels. In 2013, I spent the better part of the year in Xi'an, China as a Fulbright-Hays Scholar.</p>
    <p>When I'm not at my computer, I like to be far, far away from my computer. That usually means hiking, camping, or just being outdoors.</p>
