    <a id="hi-there" class="anchor" href="#About" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hello World</h3>
    <p><b>Hi, I'm Christine.</b> I'm currently pursuing an MS at the University of Chicago Harris School's program in <a href="https://capp.uchicago.edu/">Computational Analysis and Public Policy</a>.</p>
    <p>I like working out puzzles with code and data. I'm driven by solving civic and social problems that have positive human impact. Issues that excite me are often at the intersection of policy and technology, such as privacy, civic tech, and the governance of emerging technologies.</p>
    <p>Last summer, I served as a fellow in the Mayor's Office of Chicago, where I analyzed data and wrote policy recommendations on initiatives related to sustainability, absenteeism, criminal justice, and self-driving cars. I also spent a good deal of the summer teaching policy wonks to code and honing my foosball skills.</p>
    <p>In previous lives, I was an international development project coordinator for Education Development Center, a climate change organizer for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a lettuce farming intern in Massachusetts, and an apprentice builder of solar hot air panels. In 2013, I spent the better part of the year in Xi'an China as a Fulbright-Hays Scholar.</p>
    <p>When I'm not at my computer, I like to be far, far away from my computer. That usually means hiking, camping, or just being outdoors.</p>

    <p><h4>Detecting Bias in Police Complaints with Machine Learning</h4></p>
    <p>This project sought to detect potential bias in police investigations using differentiated feature sets with supervised machine learning. The project tested the hypthesis that the inclusion of complainant demographic data would boost the predictive abilities of modeling the outcome of police misconduct complaints in Chicago.

    <h4><p>South Side Civic Scope-a-thon, October 2016</p></h4>
    <p>As co-president of <a href="http://www.southsidecivic.net/">South Side Civic</a>, a CAPP-student led group at UChicago, I helped organize the second annual Civic ScopeAthon. Part hackathon, part case competition, the Civic ScopeAthon's main objective is to help students learn problem scoping skills while competing to solve data and technology challenges for local civic organizations.

    <p>Python 101 for Policy - Mob Programming, July 2016</p></h4>
    <p>
    This workshop was designed for policy professionals in the Mayor's Office of Chicago. The goal was for participants to gain an understanding of what computer programming is and how it can be useful in a policy setting. Participants were able to write FizzBuzz in Python by the end of the workshop.
