    <a id="hi-there" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hello World</h3>
    <p><b>Hi, I'm Christine.</b> I'm currently pursuing an MS at the University of Chicago Harris School's program in <a href="https://capp.uchicago.edu/">Computational Analysis and Public Policy</a>. I'm happiest working on issues at the intersection of tech, policy, and social justice.</p>
    <p>As a programmer, I'm interested in using code and data to solve social and civic problems with human impact. As a graduate student, I've applied my data analysis and programming skills as a research assistant with <a href="http://www.rdcep.org/">RDCEP</a> and <a href: "http://www.rdcep.org/">CivicScape.</a> </p>
    <p>Last summer, I served as a fellow in the Mayor's Office of Chicago where I worked on the city's challenges related to <a href:"https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/progs/env/EnergyBenchmark/2016_Chicago_Energy_Benchmarking_Report.pdf">sustainability</a>, <a href:"https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/mayor/absenteeism%20task%20force/2016Q4PublicDashboard.pdf">absenteeism</a>, criminal justice, and self-driving cars. I also spent a good deal of the summer     <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yOpaor-cT5z4uBJgF3r8UaqaCHCnw76CGn9boZ923xs/edit?usp=sharing">teaching policy wonks to code</a> and honing my foosball skills.</p>
    <p>In previous lives, I was an international development project coordinator for <a href="http://www.edc.org/">Education Development Center</a>, a climate change organizer for the <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org">Union of Concerned Scientists</a>, an <a href ="http://pleasantvalleygardens.com/">agricultural intern</a> on a vegetable farm, and an apprentice builder of solar hot air panels. In 2013, I spent the better part of the year in Xi'an, China as a <a href:"http://howimetxian-blog.tumblr.com/">Fulbright-Hays Scholar.</a></p>
    <p>When I'm not at my computer, I like to be far, far away from my computer. That usually means hiking, camping, or just being outdoors.</p>

            <h4>Detecting Unusual Trends in University Energy Usage</h4>
            <p><strong>Data Analysis & Visualization</strong> | <em>Spring 2016</em></br>
            In collaboration with the University's facilities department, this project was designed to help the university detect anomalous energy usage patterns in historical energy data, with the potential to detect events in real time. Implemented an algorithm to detect unusual periods of activity in energy time series data using markov models.</p>

            <h4>Detecting Bias in Police Complaints with Machine Learning</h4>
            <p><strong>Data Science & Policy</strong> | <em>Spring 2016</em></br>
            This project sought to detect potential bias in police investigations using differentiated feature sets with supervised machine learning. The project tested the hypthesis that the inclusion of complainant demographic data would boost the predictive abilities of modeling the outcome of police misconduct complaints in Chicago.</p>
